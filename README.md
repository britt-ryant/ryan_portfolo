This is my portfolio webbsite.  Most functionality resides in the user CRUD and the admin/user dashboard.  This breaks traditional formatting/functionaliyt to demonstrate the uses of all/the interchangability.  Some SQL queries not necessary however, they demonstrate the use/knowledge of SQL.  This website contains a combination of Functional Components and Class Components stricty to demonstrate the manipulation of state in both as well as demonstrating different ways that both can interact in the same application.  State is both stored in the redux store and in local class components.

Admin information is stored in .env file....to log in to admin account username: "MaggieBear@gmail.com" password: "Pscode4116939!";



Notes: 


--Some Functional Components use useState from react-redux, others use connect from react-redux to manipulate useState
